There are <strong>N</strong> graphs in the shop and the cost of <strong>i<sup>th</sup></strong> graph is <strong>a[i]</strong>.&nbsp;Geek wants to buy all the graphs which are in the shop and for every <strong>K</strong> graphs he buys he gets one extra graph free due to the sale. He wants to spend as less as possible. You have to find out minimum amount of money he has to spend to buy all the graphs.</span><br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Input:</strong><br>
1.&nbsp;The first line of the input contains a single integer<em> </em> <strong>T</strong> denoting the number of test cases. The description of&nbsp;<strong>T</strong> test cases follows.<br>
2.&nbsp;The first line of each test case contains two-space separated&nbsp;integers <strong>N </strong>and <strong>K</strong>.<br>
3.&nbsp;The second line of each test case&nbsp;contains <strong>N</strong> space-separated integers which represents <strong>a[]</strong>.</span><br>
