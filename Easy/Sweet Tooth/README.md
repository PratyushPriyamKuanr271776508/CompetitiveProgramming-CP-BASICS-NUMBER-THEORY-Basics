She told him that he had to divide the number <strong>N</strong> which is the number of sweets he got&nbsp;into two non-empty parts for example N = 1234 can be divided into 1 and 234 or 12 and 34 and so on and he could have as many sweets as the&nbsp;product of the sum of digits of both parts. Help him eat as many as he can.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Input:</strong><br>
1.&nbsp;The first line of the input contains a single integer<em> </em> <strong>T</strong> denoting the number of test cases. The description of&nbsp;<strong>T</strong> test cases follows.<br>
2.&nbsp;The first line of each test case contains an integer <strong>N</strong>, the numbers of sweets.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Output:</strong><br>
For each test case print, the maximum number of sweets Jack can have.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Constraints:</strong><br>
1. 1 ≤ T ≤ 10<sup>4</sup><br>
2. 10 ≤ N&nbsp;≤&nbsp;10<sup>16</sup></span></p>
