Sasha has <strong>c</strong> grams of chocolate which she wants to divide between both of her children. She will divide her chocolate into two parts (one part can be possibly empty)&nbsp;and will give exactly one part to each child.&nbsp;She wants to divide her chocolate in such a way that difference between amount of chocolates both children&nbsp;have after Sasha has given them her chocolate is minimum. For dividing chocolate Sasha uses a weighing machine which has precision upto six decimal places. You have to print how many grams of chocolate each child has after Sasha has given them her chocolate separated by space. You should use the same weighing machine for finding out the answer.</span><br>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Input:</strong><br>
1.&nbsp;The first line of the input contains a single integer<em> </em> <strong>T</strong> denoting the number of test cases. The description of&nbsp;<strong>T</strong> test cases follows.<br>
2.&nbsp;The first line of each test case contains three-space separated&nbsp;integers <strong>a</strong>,<strong> b&nbsp;</strong>and <strong>c</strong>.</span><br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Output:</strong> For each test case, print the answer. Precision of the answer should be exactly upto six decimal places.</span><br>

<strong>Explanation:</strong>
<strong>Test Case 1 :</strong> Sasha gives 0.500000 grams 
of her chocolate to first child and rest 
of the chocolate to other.</span>
